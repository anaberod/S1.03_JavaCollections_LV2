# ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This repository contains two Java exercises focused on working with collections, object uniqueness, and sorting with custom criteria.

# ðŸ§© Exercises Summary

- **Exercise 1:** Create a `Restaurant` class with `name` and `rating` attributes. Insert `Restaurant` objects into a `HashSet` while ensuring that no two restaurants with the same name and rating coexist. Restaurants with the same name but different ratings are allowed.

- **Exercise 2:** Extend the `Restaurant` class functionality by implementing sorting. `Restaurant` objects must be ordered first alphabetically by name, and if the names are identical, by rating in descending order.
